# GOAL OF THE GAME
Players play their hand of cards while trying not to get any cards from the parade.\
Nobody wants points in Wonderland.

# GAME COMPONENTS
- 66 cards in 6 colors with values ranging from 0 to 10 (10 being represented by the letter T)
- Scoring zone

# PREPARATION OF THE PARADE
The start player is determined randomly. Each player is dealt 5 cards. 6 more cards are placed next to each other following the draw pile (represented as *Cards Left: XX*); these cards are the initial participants of the parade. The draw pile marks the front of the parade. The other side is called the end of the parade. The remaining cards are placed inside the draw pile.

# SEQUENCE OF PLAY
During your turn, you perform the following actions in the order given below.
1. Choose one of the cards in your hand by selecting a number from 1 to 5 to lay it at the end of the parade.
2. If necessary, cards will be removed from the parade and laid in your scoring zone. \[automatic\]
3. Draw a card from the draw pile. \[automatic\]
The next player performs the same actions during their turn.

# EXPLANATION OF THE ACTIONS
1. The player chooses one of the cards in his hand and places it at the end of the parade. This card does not count when totaling the number of cards in the next action (action 2).
2. Depending on which card is played, some cards have to be removed from the parade.
If the number of cards already taking part in the parade is less than or equal to the value of the played card, no cards have to be removed from the parade.\
If the number of cards already taking part is larger than the value of the played card then some cards might leave the parade.\
To determine which cards might have to be removed, start numbering the cards from the end of the parade down towards the front, not taking into account the card that was just played. Every card with a position number larger than the value of the played card enters the “removal mode”.\
To determine which cards in removal mode have to leave, remove the cards that follow these rules:
- All cards with the same color as the played card
- All cards with a value less than or equal to the value of the played card (see the example below.)
The removed cards are collected and divided into colors in the player's scoring zone. The values of all cards must be visible for all players.\
The remaining cards in the parade are moved forward towards the front of the parade to close the gaps.\
If a card with the value 0 is played, all cards enter removal mode.
3. The player draws a card from the draw pile to replenish his hand to 5 cards.

*A card (Green-3) is played from the hand and laid at the end of the parade. Since the card value is 3, you ignore the next three cards as they are unaffected by the card that was just played. The remaining four cards are available to be removed and here is what is taken by the player.*\
*All cards with the same color as the played card: the Green-0 and Green-7 cards have to be removed.*\
*All cards with a value less than or equal to the value of the played card: the Red-3 card has to be removed.*\
*Remember, you only remove cards that are in “removal mode”.*
